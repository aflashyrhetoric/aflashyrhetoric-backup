    <p><span class="about-accent bold">Six years ago</span>, a family friend showed me her new website. "I got it done professionally," she said.
  </p>
  <p>I saw the site and cringed.</p>
  <p>It had obnoxious electric-blue banners and indecipherable fonts. Things were scrolling and flashing all over the place. In the corner, I spotted a stolen watermarked stock photo. I wasn't a professional, but I knew this wasn't good work.</p>
  <p><span class="about-accent big bold">She had paid nearly <strong>$800</strong> for this steaming pile of website.</span> </p>
  <p>It was a <strong>crime</strong>. I decided to learn HTML & CSS and re-did her site for free. Granted, it wasn't amazing, but it was something.</p>
  <p>She smiled when I showed her the revision. I was hooked.</p> 
  <p>Since then, web design has become a bit of an obsession of mine. I researched modern design standards, seeking to improve my process in every possible way. I'd obsess about text editors (Sublime all the way!), responsive layouts, front-end/back-end frameworks, private VPS servers, all that jazz.</p>
  <p>I learned quite a bit about what a website can be: anything from a personal journal to a public portfolio; a simple online business card to a primary source of income.</p>
  <p>I've also learned that many wonderful people tend to compromise for cheaper lower-quality sites, operating under the impression that a proper website will break the bank.</p>
  <p><span class="big about-accent">I'm here to dispel this notion.</span></p>
  <p>Ubiquitous, accessible, and affordable. Websites have become <hem>the</em> way to build a solid, unique identity to show the world.</p>
  <p><span class="about-accent big">I'm passionate about what I do.</span></p>
  <p>I believe in bold designs that don't sacrifice functionality. I believe that honest conversations are the best way to producing great work.</p>
