    description: "WORK-IN-PROGRESS. A story that attempts to explore what would happen if quantum computing was achieved, say, next year. Humanity can now explore further, analyze faster, and artificial intelligence is on-the-rise. No, this isn't about a robot uprising. Another true problem arises, though: since finding solutions through brute-force methods is now feasible, nothing is secure. Passwords are irrelevant."
