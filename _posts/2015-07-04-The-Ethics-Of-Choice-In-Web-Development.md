# Choosing the right web solution

## First, The Good.
In the past five years or so, the web development scene has seen a surge of new technologies that simplify the process of building complicated websites. Many of the technical, lower-level aspects of web development are abstracted away into neat little libraries. This has made many developers very happy. 

### Unfortunately, the same isn't always true for the clients.

In fact, the opposite can be true.

The job of a web developer is (more or less) as follows. First, assess the client's needs. 
Second, consider solutions to the problem that leverage the power of the web. 
Third, work to implement these solutions - create useable deliverables for the client. 

The first and third steps are just matters of communication and hard work, respectively. They're still highly nuanced tasks, of course, but nothing ethically complicated.

It's during the second step - considering and deciding upon a solution - that an interesting ethical choice emerges.

Assuming I've already assessed the client's needs and considered various solutions, I now have to make a decision.  
# Choice One.
Offer my advice to xpressed discontent the client about the best way to proceed. I choose *for* them. This method omits technical details from the conversation, and entrusts the developer to handle the big-picture stuff.

***How It Might Sound**: "We should use WordPress to create your website because of its reliability, and we'll use GoDaddy for hosting since it's affordable and easy to use."*

# Choice Two.
Explain the client's many options and allow them to choose. They make the choice. I include all technical details and let them pick.

***How It Might Sound**: "WordPress websites cost $X to develop and has access to hundreds of plugins. Ruby On Rails costs $Y to develop, and they allow for absolute customizability. You choose."*

Initially, **Choice Two** - allowing the client to choose - seemed the better choice. Under this configuration, I was performing my duty to the client by telling them about their options. The client then makes the final decision about how to proceed. 

This has a dual benefit, or so I thought: the client *gets what they want*, and I am free from liability should something go wrong. If they were unsatisfied with the end-product, I could defend myself with an indignant, "it was your decision to do it this way, not mine."

As an individual freelancer, this was very tempting.

I soon realized that this was very wrong.

I had critically misinterpreted what I was offering. I wasn't simply selling a website, I was *selling my knowledge.*. My experience. My value as a web developer was in my ability to juggle a variety of technical details so that my clients don't have to.

Should we use WordPress or SquareSpace? Perhaps a custom CMS built from scratch? If the latter, should we use PHP or Ruby/Rails? Should we use GoDaddy or Namecheap as our registrar? DigitalOcean droplet or Heroku or other? Bootstrap or Foundation? Blah blah blah.

Sifting through these questions, determining which details are significant, and trying to piece together a coherent solution that efficiently, affordably, and elegantly addresses the client's problems - these are my skills. This is what I have to offer.

The website was simply the end result of this lengthy mental process. But work unseen doesn't equate to laziness - far from it.

## Trust Me.

I've since changed my perspective. Shifting responsibility to my clients - a less-informed party when it comes to web development - is irresponsible; it is a cheap, even cowardly way to claim innocence when something goes wrong. 

The best way to prevent unsatisfied clients is simply: be an expert. Rather than sneakily evading responsibility, it's my job to assume full responsibility so that the client doesn't have to - and make damn good choices that make the client happy. 

Granted, this isn't easy. I am passionate and obsessive about what I do, but I'm only human. I hold myself to the highest standard when it comes to creating websites. I obsess over every pixel, literally. But I'm only human. Every web design agency out there is fallible. And hey, you may prefer orange, where I prefer purple.

Web development is a give-and-take, an endeavor that is simultaneously concerned with immensely creative and technical questions. But by opening the lines of communication with the client, by maintaining elite and ethical standards in my work, and by constantly exploring ways to improve, I believe that we can come together to create something awesome. 

Be it a small-scale studio art portfolio, a photo-focused travel blog, a text-centric poetry archive, or a full-fledged e-commerce website. So let's get to work.
