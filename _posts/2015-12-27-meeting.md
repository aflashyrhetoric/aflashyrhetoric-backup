2. Events
3. Meeting Agendas
4. Small Group Structure + Design
5. Social Media Campaigns  
6. Other Initiatives
    

**Obstacles**:
What challenges are we facing?
- If I need help with a media project, who can I ask?
- If you have an idea for small group, who do you talk to?
    - And who has the power to "make it happen"?
    - Who can you ask for help?
- If PJ has a question regarding small group design, who should *he* ask?
    + Is Helen / MJ responsible for everything? Too much pressure.

**Goal**: 
By the end of this meeting, hopefully everyone should have a better idea of:
- Who does what?
- Who has what powers?
- Who should help who?
- What initiatives are in place?
- What to do if you have a problem
- What to do if you have a new idea

**Overall Goal**: So that everyone knows what they're in charge of, what they *can* do, and so our internal structure is strong and robust enough to handle our big ambitions.

## A Clarification:
This is my proposal on *how to begin* to organize our internal structure. We need to define roles, and assign them. I have some ideas about what the roles could be. This outline is somewhat opinionated, but it's not very restrictive, so I hope you'll give it a chance. Any execution plan like this can get extremely detailed, but I've tried to focus on only those details that are necessary. 

## Further Clarification: 
I'm aware of the dangers of becoming "title-crazy." I'm not trying to create rigid, strict roles, though it may sound that way. 

    "They're more like guidelines, really." 
    - Captain Barbossa (Pirates Of The Caribbean)

This meeting is focused on defining "roles" and assigning them, and quickly acknowledging the other tasks that still remain, such as creating a meeting agenda, creating a small group structure, etc.

These roles not about *allowing* certain people to do something VS *disallowing* other people to do other things. It's primarily to establish who is *taking point* and leading the initiatives, projects, etc.

## Before We Start: A Note Regarding "Power":
People will be taking on responsibilities, so we are agreeing to grant them the powers necessary to get their job done. Trust, respect, and love, will be necessary for any such system to work, and no "power" granted is immutable.

# General "Requirements"
### Stuff that hopefully everyone can agree on
---
#### We're saying this explicitly even though it's obvious.
- Keep criticisms and discussions constructive (Criticisms should be paired with suggestions for alternatives, if possible)
- Do not micro-manage (trust but verify)
- Be humble, prayerful.
- **Guard each other's hearts**

## Probationary Period - 2 Months (An Idea)
Purpose:
A "probationary" or "trial" period will prevent: 
- Anyone from getting stuck in a role they dislike
- Any incompatible people from remaining in their role ("gift assessment")
- Power-hungry rampages

It will also provide:
- A window for us to provide very open feedback. (None of us are professionals, that is not the expectation)
- A chance to add/subtract responsibilities/powers as necessary
- A chance, at the end of the period, to revisit role definitions, nominations, etc.
